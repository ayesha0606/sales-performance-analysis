# Sales Performance & Customer Insights Dashboard
## Overview
This project analyzes sales performance and customer behavior using SQL and Power BI.
The objective is to identify revenue trends, top-performing products, regional performance,
and customer retention patterns to support data-driven business decisions.
## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Power BI
- CSV Dataset (Sample Superstore)
## Key KPIs
- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- Total Orders
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Repeat Customer Rate
## SQL Analysis
The SQL analysis includes:
- Revenue and profit aggregation
- Month-over-month sales growth
- Customer repeat rate calculation
- Top customers and products by revenue
- Pareto (80/20) analysis
All SQL queries are available in the `SQL/QUERIES.sql` file.
## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Monthly sales trend analysis (2014–2017)
- Top 10 products by total sales
- Region-wise sales performance
- Interactive filters by Segment, Region, and Category
- Business-focused insights derived from KPIs
## Key Insights
- Approximately 20% of products contribute to the majority of total revenue, indicating a strong Pareto effect.
- The West and East regions generate the highest sales and should be prioritized for inventory and marketing.
- A repeat customer rate above 99% suggests strong customer retention, though it may also indicate limited new customer acquisition.
## Dataset
- Sample Superstore Dataset (public retail dataset)
